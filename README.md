# Computer Network Projects

This is a codebase for C-implementation of computer network projects in UCLA CS118 course.

The concepts related to physical, data link, and IP layer are written in short answers.

The projects include writing a comprehensive algorithm for computing the CRC checksum in data link, as well as implementing a router that handles ARP, IPv4, ICMP requests and directs packages through maximum prefix matching.
